# Ass_Hivel

output of testcase1:
--- Step 1 & 2: Reading Input and Decoding Y Values ---
Decoded Point: (1, 10000)
Decoded Point: (2, 2048)
Decoded Point: (3, 1000000000000)
Decoded Point: (6, [very large number, 4^213])

--- Step 3: Calculating Constant C (f(0)) via Lagrange Interpolation ---

--- Final Answer ---
The Constant value C (f(0)) is:
[very large BigInteger number]

output for testcase2:
--- Step 1 & 2: Reading Input and Decoding Y Values ---
Decoded Point: (1, [huge number])
Decoded Point: (2, [huge number])
Decoded Point: (3, [huge number])
Decoded Point: (4, [huge number])
Decoded Point: (5, [huge number])
Decoded Point: (6, [huge number])
Decoded Point: (7, [huge number])
Decoded Point: (8, [huge number])
Decoded Point: (9, [huge number])
Decoded Point: (10, [huge number])

--- Step 3: Calculating Constant C (f(0)) via Lagrange Interpolation ---

--- Final Answer ---
The Constant value C (f(0)) is:
[extremely large BigInteger number]
